      I am a Frontend Developer with 2+ years of experience in building
      responsive, accessible, and performance-optimized web applications. My
      journey into the world of web development began with a fascination for how
      the web works, and this curiosity has driven me to continually learn and
      evolve in this fast-paced field.
